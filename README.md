OSDG is an open-source tool that assigns labels to scientific content based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

**We are working on big updates. Please check `pre-release` branch.**

A version of the OSDG tool is available at [OSDG website](https://www.osdg.ai). There user can classify publications by inputting:
1) a single DOI,
2) multiple DOIs in one CSV file,
3) a text fragment.

**Check out our paper on ArXiv [OSDG -- Open-Source Approach to Classify Text Data by UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14569)**
